- select and deselect modules based on what's installed
	(give friendly message explaining what will happen!!!)

- disable uninstalled modules (don't uninstall)

- run installer for modules that are to be installed - if they require another module, we will have to ask for it
	(maybe sharedinfo needs to become a function?)
	This is a real problem: lets say that usage is installed and now we add reports.
	Here is reports' list of dependencies:
	["reports"]=>
	array(6) {
	  [0]=>
	  string(8) "db_tools"
	  [1]=>
	  string(32) "have_read_write_access_to_config"
	  [2]=>
	  string(14) "modules_to_use"
	  [3]=>
	  string(5) "usage"
	  [4]=>
	  string(20) "have_default_db_user"
	  [5]=>
	  string(17) "some_kind_of_auth"
	}
